# Migration

## From v2.x to v3.x

**No longer support for IE11.**

The main aspect of 3.x.x, is that bundles will not support IE11 going forward to reduce the footprint of supporting Promises and other ES6 native functions.

Other changes:

-   Video player used to pause media when clicking on the main area; it has been disabled by default, and to activate that behavior back, you need to set the `media.pauseOnClick` property as `true`.
-   No longer support for simplified use of the player by setting the `op-player__media` class: you will need to use Javascript to instantiate OpenPlayerJS.

## From v2.6.1 to v2.7.0

After updating Typescript to a newer version, all "private" variables are now truly not accessible at runtime. For more information, check the [Javascript section](./docs/usage.md#javascript).

## From v1.x.x to v2.x.x

In order to achieve a smooth upgrading between version `1.x.x` and `2.x.x`, there is a couple of things to keep in mind:

1. The player will only accept now 2 parameters instead of 4: the **player ID** and the **player options**.
2. `controls` and `showLiveProgress` properties are now complex object structures, where we can indicate visibility and a new set of extra layers/visibility.

To simplify this even more:

### v1.x.x

```javascript
const player = new OpenPlayerJS('player', 'https://ads.example.url/xml', true, {
    controls: {
        left: ['play', 'time', 'volume'],
        middle: ['progress'],
        right: ['captions', 'settings', 'fullscreen'],
    },
    showLiveProgress: false,
    // ...other player options
});
player.init();
```

### v2.x.x

```javascript
const player = new OpenPlayerJS('player', {
    ads: {
        src: 'https://ads.example.url/xml', // equivalent to the second argument in v1.x.x
        // ...other ads options
    },
    mode: 'fullscreen', // equivalent to `true` in third argument in v1.x.x
    controls: {
        alwaysVisible: false,
        // Also available: `top-left`, `top-middle`,
        // `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-middle` and `bottom-right` or `main`
        layers: {
            left: ['play', 'time', 'volume'],
            middle: ['progress'],
            right: ['captions', 'settings', 'fullscreen'],
        },
    },
    live: {
        showLabel: true,
        showProgress: false, // equivalent of `showLiveProgress` in v1.x.x
    },
    // ...other player options
});
player.init();
```
