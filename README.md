## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT ðŸš¨

### ðŸ”§ This repository is in maintenance at this point. ðŸ”§

No new features or additions will be added, only bug fixes.

## Advantages

-   Supports **all modern browsers**.
-   **No dependencies**, since it is written in Typescript.
-   Runs a simple but yet powerful algorithm to **check the browser's autoplay capabilities** across browsers.
-   **Enhance your player** adding your own buttons. Check [here](./docs/customize.md) for more details.
-   Provides the ability to use a **single VAST/VPAID** source or a **VAST/VPAID playlist** from several different sources (including URLs and valid XML strings).
-   **Can play ads in infinite loop**, desired for ads that are in a heavy text page.
-   Always **responsive** by default, for both video/audio tags; for video, **`fill`** and **`fit`** modes are available to either scale and crop media relative to its parent container, or to attempt to make the media fit its parent container (including black bars), respectively.
