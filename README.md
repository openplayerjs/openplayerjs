This is a media player that uses all the goods of HTML5 video/audio elements to play the most popular media in MP4/MP3, HLS and M(PEG)-DASH, and also has the ability to play VMAP, VAST and VPAID ads.

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT ðŸš¨

**Version 3.0** of this player just started to being worked on.

As part of a continuous effort to improve the player, this new version will include, among others:

-   An increased unit test coverage (aiming to have at least `70%`), including unit tests for all the demos.
-   Refactor of areas of code where creation of buttons for controls occurs, into a consolidated method to generate them.
-   Refactor of the main operations (`load`, `loadAd`, `play`, `pause`) to use Promises in a more clear fashion, and with that, execute more complex operations consistently, specially when dealing with loading dynamic content.
-   Better snippets/documentation to help users to configure OpenPlayerJS for their needs.
-   And more...

Because of the refactor that will be performed in that version, **support for IE11 will be dropped completely**. Also, to support the effort of [ending the IE11 life cycle, scheduled on **June 15, 2022**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge#:~:text=Internet%20Explorer%2011-,Is%20Internet%20Explorer%2011%20the%20last%20version%20of%20Internet%20Explorer,systems%20starting%20June%2015%2C%202022.).

So, please consider this before upgrading to any of the 3.x.x version going forward.

## Advantages

-   Supports **IE11+ (Win8) and all modern browsers**.
-   **No dependencies**, since it is written in Typescript.
-   Runs a simple but yet powerful algorithm to **check the browser's autoplay capabilities** across browsers.
-   Supports for **local and remote captions** for **both video and audio**, even without including the `crossorigin` attribute.
-   **Enhance your player** adding your own buttons. Check [here](./docs/customize.md) for more details.
-   Provides the ability to use a **single VAST/VPAID** source or a **VAST/VPAID playlist** from several different sources (including URLs and valid XML strings).
-   **Can play ads in infinite loop**, desired for ads that are in a heavy text page.
-   Always **responsive** by default, for both video/audio tags; for video, **`fill`** and **`fit`** modes are available to either scale and crop media relative to its parent container, or to attempt to make the media fit its parent container (including black bars), respectively.
